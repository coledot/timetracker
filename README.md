# TimeTracker

## Disclaimer

These are my very first lines of Ruby, and this is purely meant to be a make-your-feet-wet
project, so clone this stuff only if you want to read some very ugly Ruby code

## What I ask to TimeTracker

I want to write a very simple piece of software that lets me easily keep track of time spent
on given issues. Once it works from CLI, a bonus could be to have an easy way to sync this
timesheets to some external PM software like Redmine via REST APIs
